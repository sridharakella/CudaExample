Cuda Examples 

Portable Batch System (PBS) and the Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (Slurm) 

sample PBS 
qsub(queuesubmit) qstat, qdel, qalter



Slurm (slurmctld is installed on master , slurmd is installed on compute node, slurmd for database deamon)

Slurm entties:
Nodes, Patitions , Jobs and Jobs steps.

scontrol(only executed root user, slurm state).
sinfo(state of partitions, and nodes managed from slurm, has filtering, sorting)
squeue( heavinly used, reports the jobs in priortiy order)
scancel( to cancel the )
sacct( used for accounting information, about completed jobs)
srun/sbatch( to submit the jobs for later execution)

Performance measure for GPU:


Throughput-    calculated the number of floating points for second

Clock speed  ( sometimes higher clock speed doesn't mean it is good, it takes more power consumption).

Hopper architecture ( needs cuda version atleastÂ  cuda 11.8 toolkit)
